<h2 id='description'>Description</h2>

This application will allow the user to create and delete notes. The notes are saved to the application's database so they persist through multiple visits. As the user, they will type in the title and content of the note that they
want to make, and then click the save button to the top right hand corner of the screen. The note will then be save and a minimized version of that note will display on the list on the left hand side of the screen. When the user clicks
on the minimized version of the note, the note's details will populate in the section to the right of the list. If the user press the  '+' in the top right hand corner, the note title and body will empty and allow the user to create a 
new note. If the user clicks on the red trash can icon, it will delete the associated note.
